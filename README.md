cvBlob-for-Android
==================

cvBlob is a library designed specifically for Android, in order to perform blob detection and extraction. The library has been designed based on a single-pass algorithm, detecting first the blobs, and then labeling and optimizing them.

I used as a base the Java algorithm proposed by Dr. Andrew Greensted, although I soon realized that the implementation was not suitable for Android based-phones. With the library there is a sample application provided, so you can check the basics.

If you have any comment about the library, feel free to contact me at eenriquelopez@gmail.com

You can access further information about labeling tables and labeling.

You can download an APK demo or the full library

Remember that in order to use the library, you have to add to your project as a library. In order to accomplish that, you should add it on the target project, under "Properties -> Android -> Add Library"
